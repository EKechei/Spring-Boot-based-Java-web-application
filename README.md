# Overview

This project showcases a CI/CD pipeline for a Java-based application. The pipeline is divided into two parts:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Managed by Jenkins, focusing on building, testing, and packaging the application.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Handled by Argo CD, which deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster using GitOps principles.
The setup ensures a streamlined, automated, and efficient development-to-deployment workflow.
